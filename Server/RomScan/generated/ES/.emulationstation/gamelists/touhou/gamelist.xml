	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Team Shanghai Alice - Touhou Project/6th - The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.bat</path>
	<desc>The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil is a vertical-scrolling shooter, the sixth official game in the Tōhō series, and the first being made exclusively for the Windows platform. During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears blocking out the sun and causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. Playing as either Reimu Hakurei (a shrine maiden) or Marisa Kirisame (a playful black magician), the player has to battle his way through 6 challenging stages, and face the &quot;Scarlet Devil&quot; behind the cause. The game is a bullet hell shooter: Enemies are shooting bullets in very high counts, often creating a certain pattern covering the entire playing area. The focus lies more on evading those bullets than on shooting down enemies. The player has a normal shoot and a limited bomb option which clears the screen of any bullets. Enemies appear in multiple waves, dropping power-up and point items when shot down. The player can use a focus button, causing the character&#039;s shoot to become more powerful and his movement to become slower, which makes it easier to avoid bullets. Each stage has two bosses, one more easy mid-boss and a more difficult final one. These bosses often use multiple &quot;Spell Cards&quot;, which create a particularly difficult bullet pattern for the player to avoid.</desc>

	<desc>Perfect Cherry Blossom is the seventh game in Touhou series. It&#039;s like previous game, The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, but just &quot;more&quot;. More characters, more bullets, more effects. The game is a bullet hell - the player shoots the enemies and dodges hundreds of bullets. Now, character has visible hit-box (hold shift to slow and see it.) The player can choose one of three girl characters - Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame and new Sakuya Izayoi. Each stage has mid-boss and main boss. Cherry points are new elements - reach 50,000 Cherry+ points to take a temporary shield.</desc>

	<desc>Tōhō: Imperishable Night is 2D arcade, vertical scrolling shoot&#039;em up and the eighth main game in the Tōhō series.

The game&#039;s story tells how the moon has been replaced by a fake moon that can never become full and the heroines must find the real moon before sunrise. Every stage has a timer. The player must collect a certain amount of time points. The characters fly through different environments, shoot the enemies, use special weapons (card spells) and avoid a lot of bullets.</desc>

	<desc>Phantasmagoria of Flower View is considered to be a competitive vertical danmaku shooting game, in which two characters engage in moderate-to-heavy danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. split-screen). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific Spell Attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining health points, in a manner not unlike a VS. puzzle game such as Puyo Puyo.</desc>

	<desc>Mountain of Faith features two playable characters, each with three weapon types (but no personalized Spell Card bombs). In a break from previous games, collecting power items results in an increase in &quot;option&quot; satellites around the character (for a total of four), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type. Each characters&#039; options also fire bullets, and either shift position or freeze in place in focus fire mode.</desc>

	<desc>As with Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody is a fighting game featuring a variety of Touhou Project characters. It appears to be similar in many ways to its predecessor, with many similar sprites and attacks. However, the inclusion of a new weather system that can affect the tides of battle, a 20 card deck system, and the implementation of flight marks a vast difference in gameplay between IaMP and its successor.</desc>

	<desc>Subterranean Animism features two playable characters (Reimu and Marisa), each with three weapon types representing a youkai assisting them from above ground. Like Mountain of Faith, collecting power items adds up to four &quot;option&quot; satellites around the character (or eight for the Marisa/Alice combination), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type, and can be sacrificed for a bomb effect. However, unlike Mountain of Faith, each bomb has a different behavior, and some cause special gameplay effects to occur.</desc>

In total the player can choose between 6 different ways to start UFO. However, unlike Mountain of Faith and Subterranean Animism, the spell card (bombing) system from the older games (such as Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night) has been reintroduced.</desc>

	<desc>Touhou Hisoutensoku retains the same mechanics of spell cards, spirit orbs, and weather as Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, but also introduces new playable Touhou characters, spell cards, and weather-types. Many existing spell cards, weather-types and graphics from Scarlet Weather Rhapsody have been altered and in addition to the new characters, existing characters all have new spell card moves. Additionally, each playable character now has a system card (e.g. healing, weather change, bombs, etc.) associated with her that&#039;s usable by any character once unlocked.</desc>

	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Team Shanghai Alice - Touhou Project/12.8th - Fairy Wars.bat</path>
	<desc>The game plays somewhat like a fusion of the Shoot the Bullet series and the Phantasmagoria series, combined with &quot;standard&quot; Touhou gameplay. Cirno is able to shoot regularly, but also possesses a new &quot;freezing&quot; technique that adds a new twist to the game. Similar to Aya&#039;s camera, Cirno has a counter that fills up during gameplay. To activate this technique, hold and release the shot button. When activated, Cirno&#039;s freeze attack will attack the immediate area directly in front of her, and freeze any bullets it comes in contact with for a duration proportionate to the percentage of charge before vanishing afterwards. When other bullets come into contact with frozen bullets, they too will freeze, allowing for large chains to be frozen in this way. Points and bombs are awarded for freezing large numbers of bullets.</desc>
