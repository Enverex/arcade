	<desc>Originally an arcade machine, Cruis&#039;n USA was then released for the Nintendo 64. The game asks players to choose from four vehicles to race in a variety of courses throughout the USA —based on real locations, their names are: Golden Gate Park, US 101, LA Freeway, Arizona (easy mode); Beverly Hills, Death Valley, Iowa, Indiana, Appalachia (medium difficulty mode); San Francisco, Redwood Forest, Grand Canyon, Chicago, Washington, D.C. (expert mode). Various pre-race options included are the choice of automatic or manual transmission, various controller configurations, as well as background music selection option. Players take control of the vehicle from a third-person perspective, and while avoiding various hazards along the way, must beat the clock as well as the CPU-controlled rivals to achieve first place.</desc>

	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Nintendo - Wii VC N64/F-Zero X (USA) (N64) (Virtual Console).wad</path>
	<desc>Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents. Where the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a &#039;ghost car&#039; recording of your best previous lap, a lá Mario Kart 64. Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the &quot;X&quot; tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start. One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play. This game has a rock soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the bestial grunting found only in death metal music.</desc>

	<desc>Kirby&#039;s adventure for the Nintendo 64 is a polygonal side-scroller similar to Klonoa - however, unlike Klonoa, the game only follows one set path instead of multiple branching paths. In this game, Kirby can still copy the abilities of his foes - but in addition to this, he can combine these abilities with others to make unique combinations (For one example, combining electricity and ice will turn Kirby into a fridge that spits out food). The story begins with Dark Matter assaulting a faraway land for their special crystal. A young fairy called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it. She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the crystal have shattered and landed all across the world. Kirby volunteers to help and together they go to find all the missing pieces. Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter. He&#039;ll have to battle them to rescue them. From there, they travel together to other different worlds, including Rock Star, Water Star, and Ripple Star, Ribbon&#039;s home world, where Dark Matter is lurking. To properly finish the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels. Only then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.</desc>

	<desc>Since Mario rescued Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, he&#039;s been thoroughly enjoying his free time. Bowser hasn&#039;t been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn&#039;t allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they&#039;ve come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo&#039;s cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special &quot;Time Attack Mode,&quot; where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you&#039;ll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional &quot;Club Handicap Mode&quot; ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won&#039;t get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.</desc>

	<desc>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad&#039;s Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser&#039;s Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong&#039;s Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess&#039;s smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong&#039;s. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game&#039;s unique power-ups.</desc>

	<desc>Mario and a range of well known Nintendo characters, including Yoshi, Bowser, Luigi, and Wario return for some more party action. The second edition includes 5 new boards, each with a specific theme, such as Space Land, Western Land, Horror Land, and Mystery Land. Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, but the main goal is the same: complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end. The single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.</desc>

Of course, there is your normal tournament mode, with up to 4 players in on the action, and some crazy arenas, especially Bowser&#039;s Castle, which is suspended above a lava pit!</desc>

	<desc>Magnus Gallant leads the revolution for the kingdom of Palatinus. The kingdom&#039;s Lord, Holy Lodis Empire, is rumored to be planning the domination of the entire continent of Zeteginia. This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the people of the Lord and free them from slavery forever. Ogre Battle 64 is a semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle, and is the third game in the series. Like its predecessors, the game is a tactical RPG. The main character, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and the player must control how each group attacks or defends, and whether straightforward attacks or magic shall be used. Depending on the player&#039;s choices, there are branching levels, each with their own difficulty levels. The more battles the player faces and completes, the more experience each warrior in the team gathers.</desc>

	<desc>Up in Star Haven, there exists a Star Wand that allows the stars to grant wishes to those who are pure of heart. The Star Wand is looked over by the Seven Star Spirits, who protect it in its sanctuary. However, Bowser attacks Star Haven, steals the Star Wand, and locks up the Star Spirits so that they cannot challenge his power. With his new powers, Bowser defeats Mario and lifts Princess Peach&#039;s castle into the air, taking her and all her guests as prisoners. Now, the only way to challenge Bowser&#039;s unbridled power is to rescue all seven Star Spirits, which have been imprisoned all over the land. Paper Mario is the follow-up to Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars. Basically, this is an RPG set in the Mario universe. Mario has the ability to gain experience and grow levels by defeating enemies and bosses. Mario also has the ability to recruit teammates to help him out in turn-based battles. As well, Mario can collect badges that will help his combat abilities, star pieces that he can trade for badges, and more items that he can use throughout the game. The Star Spirits will also aid him in his quest. All the characters in the game are 2D within a fully 3D world. This gives the feeling that each character is made out of &quot;paper&quot;.</desc>

	<desc>Welcome to Pokémon Puzzle League! Being selected to participate in the Official Puzzle League Tournament is one of the greatest honors a Pokémon Trainer can earn. In this brand new type of Pokémon battle, you&#039;ll have to use your strongest Pokémon to compete against the very best Trainers in Puzzle League Village. To succeed in Pokémon Puzzle League, your fingers have to be fast and your brain has to work even faster. True Pokémon Puzzle Masters will discover many ways to play the game, but the basic idea is to destroy puzzle pieces by matching up three or more blocks of the same color. The more puzzle pieces you eliminate at the same time, the more points you&#039;ll score. If you&#039;re battling another Trainer, you can send powerful attacks to their puzzle board by completing big Combos and Skill Chains. If you can&#039;t clear your stack of puzzle pieces before they reach the top of the screen, you&#039;re doomed. You&#039;ll discover many challenges as you travel through Puzzle League Village, from the exciting 3D Puzzle Mode to the brain-bruising exercises at Pokémon Puzzle University. The best way to experience Pokémon Puzzle League is to bring a friend along on your adventure. Heated two-player Pokémon battles are so intense and action-packed that you just might forget to breathe! Are you ready for this new type of Pokémon Battle?</desc>

	<desc>As Todd Snap, an aspiring Pokémon photographer, you must travel through different environment types in order to photograph as many Pokémon as you can find. With the help of Professor Oak, you will discover new places to photograph Pokémon, ranging from those such as a volcano which houses Fire Pokémon to a jungle housing Grass Pokémon. The game features 63 of the original 151 Pokémon, including favorites such as Pikachu and Charizard. Throughout your journey as a Pokémon photographer you will obtain new items from Professor Oak to help snap a photo of those Pokémon whose attention you just can&#039;t seem to attract. At first you are equipped with only an apple, but by taking great photos of various species you will get access to items such as a Pester Ball or a Poké Flute. Gameplay is similar to that of a rail-shooter, in which you move across a linear route and are only able to look around to take pictures. At the end of each route you receive a score from Oak depending on things such as the position of the Pokémon in the frame shot, the size of the Pokémon in the picture, or how many of that Pokémon are together in the shot. Up to 60 photos can be taken during each course and you choose the one to submit to Oak. All the photos you take can later be accessed in your own Pokémon album. The game features six different courses, but a seventh one can be unlocked by taking a picture of a mysterious Pokémon sign in each of the other courses. The seventh course known as Rainbow Cloud offers the only opportunity to snap a photo of the rare and elusive psychic Pokémon, Mew.</desc>

	<desc>Fox McCloud returns to once again rid evil from the Lylat System in this 64-bit remake of the SNES hit. The main aim of the game is to fly your Arwing through many levels of deadly enemies and huge end bosses with three wingmen (Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi) following to help you out. Every once in a while, you will also use the Blue Marine submarine and the Landmaster tank. The 15 levels range from forward scrolling levels (much like Panzer Dragoon or some elements of Star Wars Arcade) to full 3D arenas, each with a certain goal to achieve or boss to destroy. The bigger your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, which is split into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the final level. Multiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main characters run around with laser cannons.</desc>

	<desc>Mario is invited to Peach&#039;s castle, but when he arrives Peach is nowhere to be seen. He soon learns from Toad that Bowser has once again kidnapped her. The Koopa King has also put a spell on her castle, imprisoning her subjects. So it is up to Mario to break the spell and rescue Peach. Super Mario 64 is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining access to various parts of Bowser&#039;s castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which contain more areas. Mario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps and backflips can be executed as well. Swimming underwater now depletes Mario&#039;s oxygen level. Items must be picked up and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles. Power-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high areas.</desc>

There are 8 fully-interactive landscapes, with one for each character, with noticeable links to their games. Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D. The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (you read right). Playable characters include: Captain Falcoln* (F-Zero series) Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong games) Fox (Star Fox series) Kirby (Kirby games) Jigglypuff* (Pokémon universe) Link (Legend of Zelda series) Luigi* (Mario games) Mario (Mario games) Ness* (Mother/EarthBound series) Pikachu (Pokémon universe) Samus (Metroid series) Yoshi (Mario games) * denotes any characters that need to be unlocked under special conditions first.</desc>

	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Nintendo - Wii VC N64/Legend of Zelda, The - Majora's Mask (USA) (N64) (Virtual Console).wad</path>
	<desc>After having fulfilled Princess Zelda&#039;s request and saved the land of Hyrule from a grave danger, Link departs on his horse Epona. In the Lost Woods he is ambushed by Skull Kid, an imp who dons a mysterious mask, accompanied by the fairies Tael and Tatl. Skull Kid turns Link into a small plant-like creature known as Deku Scrub and takes away his horse and his magical ocarina. Shortly afterwards Tatl joins Link and agrees to help him revert to his native form. A meeting with a wandering mask salesman reveals that the Skull Kid is wearing Majora&#039;s Mask, an ancient item used in hexing rituals, which calls forth a menacing moon hovering over the land of Termina. Link has exactly three days to find a way to prevent this from happening. Majora&#039;s Mask is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time. It utilizes the same engine and visual style, and virtually identical interface. The game retains the traditional elements of Zelda games (dungeon exploration, sword fighting, bows, bombs, heart containers, etc.) as well as those introduced in its immediate predecessor, such as active blocking with a shield, various throwing items, and the usage of melodies played on the ocarina to solve puzzles. Compared to the previous Zelda games, this installment is more oriented towards interaction with NPCs and has a larger variety of items, optional quests, and mini-games. Also unique to this entry is its time system. The game has an internal clock, with one hour roughly corresponding to one real-life minute. If the player hasn&#039;t completed all the objectives within three in-game days, the moon falls on Termina, annihilating everyone and ending the game. However, the player can return to the first day at any time by playing a song on the ocarina, saving all quest-related progress and inventory but losing other items such as ammunition or money (unless stored in a bank). It is also possible to learn melodies that slow the time passage significantly, or advance the clock instantly to the next day. Some events happen only at specific times, and many characters follow their own schedules throughout the three days. Owl statues scattered across the land provide quick-save points and serve as teleporters between areas when discovered. Collection and usage of masks play an important role in the game. Most of the twenty-four masks that can be found in the game are optional, and usually serve to solve side quests or enhance Link&#039;s abilities, allowing him, for example, to run faster or to become invisible. Transformation masks can be used to turn Link into a Deku Scrub, a Goron, or a Zora. Each of these forms has access to unique abilities, many of which are essential to the completion of the game. Among other skills, Deku Link can shoot bubbles from his mouth and float between flowers; Goron Link can operate heavy switches and walk through lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim fast and generate force fields.</desc>

	<desc>A young boy named Link was raised in the village of the elf-like Kokiri people. One day a fairy named Navi introduces him to the village&#039;s guardian, the Great Deku Tree. It appears that a mysterious man has cursed the tree, and Link is sent to the Hyrule Castle to find out more. Princess Zelda tells Link that Ganondorf, the leader of the Gerudo tribe, seeks to obtain the Triforce, a holy relic that grants immense power to the one who possesses it. Link must do everything in his power to obtain the Triforce before Ganondorf does, and save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is the first 3D installment of the Legend of Zelda series. Like most of its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay system is similar to the previous games, allowing Link to explore the world and complete dungeons to obtain key items and advance the plot. Sword combat as well as many familiar items such as boomerang, bombs, the series&#039; currency (rupees) of various values, heart containers and their collectible fragments permanently increasing Link&#039;s health, etc., return in this installment. Link can now lock on enemies for melee and ranged combat, actively use a shield to deflect projectiles, as well as use various magic items. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games. Link can climb certain surfaces, dive underwater, as well as automatically jump. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well. Each of them has certain unique abilities: for example, only adult Link can use bow and arrows, but only the child Link can crawl through narrow spaces. During the course of the game the player obtains the Ocarina of Time. Learning and playing melodies on that ocarina is needed to advance the plot, complete certain side quests, or travel in time, switching between the two versions of Link. It is also possible to befriend and ride a horse named Epona to facilitate travel between areas.</desc>

	<desc>The objective of each race is to not only to beat the other racers but also to successfully weave the jet-ski through various buoys. There are two types of buoys: red colored, which are signified by an R on them and must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which are marked with an L and must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow will light and the jet-ski will gain speed. Up to five arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Failure to do either of these will result in a loss of power (though the arrows can be lit again) and missing five buoys over the course of a race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course (either by leaving the area limited by pink buoys or by leaving the water altogether) for more than ten seconds will also result in disqualification.</desc>

	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Nintendo - Wii VC N64/Yoshi's Story (USA) (N64) (Virtual Console).wad</path>
	<desc>Loosely based on the Super Famicom/SNES game Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#039;s Island, Yoshi&#039;s Story follows the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook &quot;pages&quot; made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools. The game pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the gameplay experience, the player being able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help the player locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick it becomes possible to float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.</desc>
