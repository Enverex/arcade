	<desc>3 Count Bout is a one-on-one fighting game. Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn&#039;t mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.</desc>

	<desc>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&#039;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium. In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</desc>

	<desc>Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat &#039;em up from the Neo-Geo&#039;s seemingly endless library of fighters. It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who&#039;s the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent&#039;s health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks. Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat &#039;em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</desc>

	<desc>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family&#039;s relation to the mob, and a person from their past. This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate. The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

	<desc>The planet Raguy was once a beautiful place, until the evil Daruma tribe invaded, bringing pollution that corrupted the land. You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It&#039;s your job to save your princess in Blue&#039;s Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can&#039;t use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy&#039;s economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.</desc>

	<desc>Somewhere in Hong Kong, two martial artists face each other in a vast courtyard. The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade hasn&#039;t touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won&#039;t be long before he would fall. &quot;Fool, you will become one of my family&quot; resounded the opponent&#039;s voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand. The Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggest. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.</desc>

But it didn&#039;t stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called &quot;The Knight of the Journey&quot; came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight&#039;s progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.</desc>

	<desc>Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot &#039;em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as &quot;run and gun&quot;) arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. The player(s) control(s) Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified &quot;federal government&quot; into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay. It is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug. The game was later ported over for the Neo Geo CD system, in 1995. The CD featured improved voice acting and added a short introduction to the game explaining the plot.</desc>

	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/SNK - Neo Geo CD/Double Dragon (World).cue</path>
	<desc>The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character&#039;s position. The player&#039;s character and his opponent have a super move meter called the &quot;charge meter&quot;, which is overlaid on the character&#039;s remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. &quot;Charge moves&quot; are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one. The characters and stages are inspired by the Double Dragon movie featured prominently in the game&#039;s intro. This includes the appearances of a submerged Hollywood, the Dragon Mobile vehicle, Billy and Jimmy&#039;s ability to transform themselves and the inclusion of Koga Shuko as the game&#039;s final boss. However, the game&#039;s characters are depicted in a more anime-like style and only six of the game&#039;s twelve fighters are actually featured in the movie; Burnov and Duke are from previous Double Dragon games and rest were created specifically for this game. This game is dedicated to Kaneto Shiozawa, who died in 2000 and Daisuke Gōri, who died in 2010.</desc>

	<desc>It has been two years since the second King Of Fighters tournament took place. Now Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and Geese are back in South Town to battle five new characters and three bosses. All of them have their own reasons of coming to South Town, but in the end, everything links to a scroll that reveals the secret to the lost ancient martial arts. Fatal Fury 3 was a pretty big improvement over its predecessors, introducing brand new re-drawn character sprites (yet again) and better overall animation quality. Of course, a handful of colorful new characters join the roster, in addition to some new 2D environments. The two-plane gameplay was upgraded to a three plane format known as the Oversway System. Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or &quot;oversway&quot; into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called &quot;Oversway Attacks&quot; and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special &amp; super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round. Along with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they&#039;ll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player&#039;s average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall, Fatal Fury 3 was easily the best presentation of the series to date.</desc>

	<desc>Football Frenzy takes the modern game of football, and tosses out all aspects of the game which don&#039;t deal directly with running the ball, throwing the ball, or hitting the guy with the ball. There are no real world teams to contend with, and no real world stats that matter aside from the game&#039;s score and the game&#039;s time. There are also no substitutions. Football Frenzy uses the Neo Geo&#039;s sprite scaling capabilities to provide either panned out or close in views depending on the action going on. The game is played from a top down perspective, but tilted to an angle so player profiles are more easily visible. Only a small portion of the field is visible at any time; to aid in orientation the game provides both a wireframe field with the current viewable portion indicated on the bottom of the screen, and a bar with sliding coloring indicating the current ball position on the field.</desc>

The heroes of the three first Tengai Makyō games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.</desc>

	<desc>Fighter&#039;s History was probably the most blatant rip-off of Street Fighter 2 in history (hence the title). Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2. Fighter&#039;s History Dynamite (also known as Karnov&#039;s Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie &amp; Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn&#039;t changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay. While playing Karnov&#039;s Revenge, there&#039;s just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn&#039;t offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre. Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?</desc>

	<desc>Power Spikes II is a 2D side-view volleyball game that presents players with three different leagues. Players can compete in either the men&#039;s league or women&#039;s league using standard volleyball rules, or in a cyber league using cybernetically enhanced players. The rules are the same for all three leagues. One team starts the game by serving the ball to the other team. As in the real sport of volleyball, the object is to hit the ball across the center net as the other team tries to do the same. If a team fails to hit the ball before it hits the ground, the team that served the ball earns a point, or earns the serve if it was on the receiving end.</desc>

	<desc>Real Bout changes the play controls from the previous Fatal Fury games, reducing the number of attack buttons from four to three: a standard Punch and Kick button, a &quot;Strong Attack&quot; button which can be either a stronger punch or kick attack, depending on the character. The game retains the three-plane &quot;oversway&quot; system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an &quot;oversway&quot; (or change plane) towards the background or foreground. Real Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge. Real Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.</desc>

	<desc>Real Bout 2 revamps the two-line battle system from Real Bout Special. Instead of fighting in either two lines, the player is now forced to fight in a main line, while the second line is a &quot;sway line&quot; used to avoid attacks (similar to the original Real Bout). The one-line trap stages last seen in Fatal Fury Special also return. The character roster from Real Bout Special returns, including Geese Howard, who is now a normally selectable character, and serves as one of the standard final bosses, alternating with Wolfgang Krauser. However, the extra versions of Tung, Mary, Andy, and Billy are gone. Two new characters are introduced: Li Xiangfei, a Chinese American waitress; and Rick Strowd, a Native American boxer. The game also features biplane pilot Alfred (the protagonist from Dominated Mind, the PlayStation version of Real Bout Special), as a secret final boss.</desc>

In spite of these little improvements, the game preserved (and improved a lot) many elements that did the previous one (Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood) a quite popular title, like the dodge move and the chance to choose between two versions of the fighter: the standard one and an alternative dark-styled one (SLASH and BUST, respectively). With the intention to provide more action in the battles, the &quot;No Contest&quot; Moves were introduced: working in similar way (and under certain conditions) to the many games of Mortal Kombat Series, your fighter will execute an ultimate-slaughter move in a stunned opponent.</desc>

Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</desc>

Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo&#039;s father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he&#039;s trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters: Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.</desc>

Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the &quot;Rival Team&quot; consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury: King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo&#039;s father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF &#039;94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named &quot;Omega Rugal&quot;.</desc>

	<desc>A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament&#039;s approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament&#039;s fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura: a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clan (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren&#039;t exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.</desc>

Within a few months of the tournament ending, various large corporations had held smaller KOF tournament qualifiers and constructed special KOF stadiums around the world, building the excitement up for the next tournament. News of the tournament spread through every form of media and fans and new fighters from across the globe come to watch the preliminary matches.</desc>

	<desc>The King of Fighters &#039;98 takes a break from the Orochi plot line and instead is presented as a &quot;Dream Match&quot; game where the KOF roster duke it out for the top spot (similar to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, but without the storyline component). Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player&#039;s choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF &#039;98, and several regular characters have hidden &quot;alternate&quot; versions that may also be used in-game. KOF &#039;98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters &#039;97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes. In addition to the Survival battle mode and the ability to choose between Single Play or Team Play, versions of the game on console systems that use CDs to contain their media (PSX, Neo-Geo CD) also include an Art Gallery one may look at.</desc>

Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.</desc>

	<desc>The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special &quot;boss&quot; characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.</desc>
