	<desc>Touki Denshou: Angel Eyes is an all-girl fighting arcade game, released by Tecmo in 1996. As Tecmo&#039;s first arcade fighting game, it suffers from severe balance issues where a single combo can completely drain a character&#039;s health. Since the game features a significant amount of aerial combat and unblockable juggle combos, a match will often be determined by which player strikes first.</desc>
