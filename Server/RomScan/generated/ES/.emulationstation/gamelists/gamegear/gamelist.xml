	<desc>Chakan is a fairly standard platform game in which you control a dead guy (Chakan has lost his soul) through many levels of hack and slash platforming. The ultimate goal is defeat all the bad-guys and so finally achieve inner-peace. The story-line (if you can call it that), does give this game an interesting image and it is much darker than most other titles available on the Genesis.</desc>
