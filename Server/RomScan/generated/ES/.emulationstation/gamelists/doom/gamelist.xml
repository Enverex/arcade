	<desc>In Doom, a nameless space marine, gets punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire upon civilians. The Martian marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation UAC, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Suddenly, one of these UAC experiments goes horribly wrong; computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely and &quot;something fragging evil&quot; starts pouring out of the gateways, killing or possessing all UAC personnel! Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where you, the space marine, are left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside to discover their worst nightmare. As you advance further, terrifying screams echo through the vast halls, followed by a disturbing silence ... it seems, all your buddies are dead and you&#039;re all on your own now - fight back, exterminate every evil creature and get your ticket back home to earth!</desc>

	<name>Doom II</name>
	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Doom/Doom II.wad</path>
	<desc>In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed most of its inhabitants or possessed them. It&#039;s your task to bring down the force field around the last operational star port to allow the remnants of mankind to escape to the stars. Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The game play once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. Doom II adds one new weapon to the players arsenal; the super shotgun, several new demon types with more advanced attacks than those of the first Doom, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the sinister Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack.</desc>

	<name>Strife</name>
	<path>/mnt/store/Emulation/Games/Doom/Strife.wad</path>
	<desc>In the distant future, the Earth is ruled by a group of people who call themselves &quot;The Order&quot;. Many disasters have plagued the planet, and after many wars, misery, and death, the Order controls people&#039;s lives and deprives them of their freedom. A rebel organization has been formed, seeking to overthrow the Order and whoever else might be behind their rise to power. Somewhere in the depths of a ruined Town Hall, a group of people who oppose the Order&#039;s regime welcome a lone wanderer to become the one who will free the Earth from terror. Strife is a plot-driven first-person shooter that uses the Doom engine. Rather than taking the player through a linear series of levels, the game offers a continuous world with free-roaming elements and a central &quot;hub&quot; (the town), which the player can visit between missions and explore. Although there are no true role-playing elements in the game, it has several features rarely seen in contemporary FPSs: there are &quot;friendly&quot; areas where there are no enemies but people to talk to, stores where new equipment can be bought, and taverns where the latest gossip is told. The player can also purchase upgrades that permanently increase the player character&#039;s health bar. The game has a branching storyline with a few paths that lead to three different endings. These paths are determined by a decision the player makes during the course of the plot.</desc>
