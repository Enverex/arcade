While Nikoli is widely known for coining the puzzle name Sudoku, they also have produced a myriad of puzzles often dealing with numbers. In this puzzle the player needs to create a loop around the fields grid without having the loop&#039;s line cross itself. This would of course present little challenge if it weren&#039;t for those pesky numbers....</desc>
